## Description

Apart from primitives, the most common sort of type you’ll encounter is an `object` type. This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them! To define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types.

For example, here’s a function that takes a point-like object:

```TypeScript
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`. You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way

The type part of each property is also optional. If you don't specify a type, it will be assumed to be `any`.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are _optional_. To do this, add a `?` after the property name:

```TypeScript
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
printName({ first: "Bob" });
printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });
```

In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn't exist, you'll get the value `undefined` rather than a runtime error. Because of this, when you _read_ from an optional property, you'll have to check for `undefined` before using it.

```TypeScript
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Error - might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
Object is possibly 'undefined'.

  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    // OK
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  }

  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```
